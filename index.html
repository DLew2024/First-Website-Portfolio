        <p>As a senior computer science major, I am passionate about crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. Being proficient in front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript and back-end languages like Java and C++, enabled me to sharpen my skills through hands-on projects and collaborative coursework. My journey has inspired a deep appreciation for both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Beyond the classroom, I have sought out internships and hands-on experiences to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. My commitment to staying ahead of the latest industry trends, combined with a dedication to continuous learning, positions me as an adaptable and forward-thinking computer scientist. Possessing a sharp attention to detail and a gift of algorithmic thinking, I am excited to contribute innovative perspectives to the dynamic world of computer science..</p>
